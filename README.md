# latex_basic_format

This repositery sums up the template for using latex. 
One can copy the file article (or book) and config, and then write inside the template .tex file in order to get an already configured latex file!

The configuration can be found inside config folder, and the names should not be changed.
The dependency is such that one should always have such directory tree:

```
Project
├── Config
│  └── the required config files
├── Project
│   └── project.tex
└── images_schools
```

In example, one can find some older projects where some pieces are interesting to understand how to use certain libraries.
