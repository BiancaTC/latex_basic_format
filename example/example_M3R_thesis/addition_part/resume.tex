As part of the completion of my Bachelor at EPFL (Lausanne), and during my year abroad at Imperial College, I worked with Pr. Jacquier upon a bachelor thesis. It was an extremely important work for me, as on the one side it completes my first higher study diploma, but also because it was my first insight on the world of finance and the world of numerical analysis. 

This paper sums up my work from November 2019 to March 2020. It was mainly personal research supervised by the knowledge, the patience and the kindness of Mr. Jacquier. 

Our aim was to follow the work proposed by Han and Wong in \cite{HanWong}, in order to simulate all the results published in their paper. Throughout that journey, I would learn the basic theory underlying that part of finance (simulation of stochastic processes and of SDEs), as well as I would get a good understanding about how to simulate models involving Black and Scholes and Heston. We finished the researches by working on how to roughen Heston and how option pricing is done.

I, also, worked in parallel independantly on neural networks. I was curious about applying my newly acquired knowledge related to machine learning upon option pricing.
