All that work was nourished by Pr. Antoine Jacquier without whom I wouldn't have been able to study all those different topics. I learnt a lot and I earned some self confidence through this work. I am deeply thankful for his time, patience, and consideration. 

I also want to thank Imperial College as well as EPFL for approving my application for a year abroad. Spending a year in London was a wonderful experience.

Finally, Iâ€™m grateful for the genuine pieces of advice I have been given by the professors I had during my final year of Bachelor. They were all very attentive to my questions. In particular, I think about Mr. Mauricio Barahona, Ms. Almut Veraart, and Mr. Pietro Siorpaes.
